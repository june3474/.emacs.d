IDLWAVE is an add-on mode built into GNU Emacs which enables feature-rich
development and interaction with IDL, the Interactive Data Language.
It provides a compelling, full-featured alternative to the IDLDE
development environment bundled with IDL.


In addition to the Emacs package and its documentation, this
repository also includes:

idlwave_catalog     A Perl program to produce your own library catalog 
                    ".idlwave_catalog" files.

tutorial.pro        Intentionally buggy practice source code for the 
		    tutorial.  See the`Getting Started' section in the
